# doom_advanced

This is a WIP revamp of Doom-Nukem, the 42 graphic branch project. 
This project consisted of building a fully functioning 3d game engine inspired by those of the famous games Doom and Duke-Nukem.

After finishing the original project with my teammates, I wanted to look for interesting ways to redo things in a cleaner, more enriched way.

Since I'm currently busy working on other stuff, this repository's advancement is in stand-by as of now.
