# doom_advanced

This is a WIP revamp of the 42 graphic branch project Doom-Nukem.
After finishing the original project with my teammates, I wanted to look for interesting ways to redo things in a cleaner, more enriched way.

Since I'm currently busy working on other stuff, this repository's advancement is in stand-by as of now.
